# Configuration
To configure additional tags, search for 'styled-components' in the IDE preferences, and enter any additional tags to treat as styled components.

For example, adding a value like `media` will enable CodeInsight for whose tag starts with it, e.g ``media.tablet`padding: 20px;` ``, ``media.desktop`padding: 10px;` ``.

# FAQ
- Why is code inside styled-components strings highlighted green?

The IDE highlights injected language fragments by default. The highlighting can be disabled in `Preferences | Editor | Color Scheme | General | Inejcted Language Fragment`.
- Why is code inside styled-components strings not reformatted?
 
 Formatting template strings with arguments is not currently supported by the IDE. Please follow this [IDE issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-28540) for updates.
- Why am I seeing syntax errors after a template argument?

<img src="./docs/error_after_argument.png">
The IDE's parser tries to determine what syntax element a template string argument replaces (property, value, etc). 
In some cases, it may be clear from code that at runtime the template argument will be a CSS property but not possible to infer the same statically:

```js
const getColor = () => condition ? "color: red;" : "color: white;";

styled.div`
  ${getColor()}
  padding-right: 10px
`;
```
In such cases, try placing a semicolon after the template argument:
```js
styled.div`
  ${getColor()};
  padding-right: 10px
`;
```
